# hcxsuite
Downloads, Compiles and Moves `hcxdumptool` and `hcxtools` executables to one folder.

hcxdumptool and hcxtools created by ZerBea: https://github.com/ZerBea/

Project pages:

https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools/

# Why
I don't use Git on puter so made a script to automagically download and compile, rather than browsing, downloading and compiling.

# Usage
Some commands included, you can run with -h or....:
-h		Displays this message

-c		Cleans up after compile and move.

-f		Fresh downloads (Deletes files before starting).

-d		Enable Debug logging in 'hcxdumptool'.

-s 		Supresses output of 'hcxdumptool' for Headless operation.

# Notes
I haven't the foggiest about Bash scripting so wanted to give it a try, hopefully somebody will get some use out of this.
